This repository contains a copy of the portable version of KeePass 2.x
that is preconfigured for long-term use. The idea is to use only global
auto-type, but in a special way. By making every window pattern a single
asterisk and using only atomic key sequences like {USERNAME}, the entire
list of key sequences is always displayed and key sequences never become
obsolete. The configuration is customized for this idea and portability.
To get started, add a database.kdbx file and run program/KeePass.exe.
