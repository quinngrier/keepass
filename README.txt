This directory contains a copy of the official portable version of
KeePass 2.28 that is preconfigured for long-term use. The trick is to
use only global auto-type, make every window pattern an asterisk, and
use only atomic key sequences like {USERNAME}. This way, every key
sequence is always available and never broken. To get going, add a
KeePass.kdbx file and run KeePass/KeePass.exe.

The following is a summary of the directory contents.
